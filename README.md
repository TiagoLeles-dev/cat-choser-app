## Decisions Made Due to Limited Time  

1. Used Expo with a navigation template for faster setup.  
2. Searched for a library that met the requirements for displaying and dragging images.  
3. Used icons from Expoâ€™s built-in library instead of importing images from Figma.  
4. Chose not to use a `.env` file for the API key to simplify testing.  
5. Implemented a fixed list as a fallback in case the API fails.  
6. I believe the number displayed on the card represents the vote count, but the voting API was not functioning properly today. I applied a workaround to ensure a default value is always displayed.
